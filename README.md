# Use of markdown

Hello! This is how to efficiently use markdown. We'll go from most used to least.

## Very Basic - Used most

### Text

To make text, just write the text required in the code:

```markdown

This is some very basic text.

Skipping a line also skips a line in the preview!

```

---

If any text surpasses the window width, it automatically overlaps, no worries!

### Headers

Headers are indicated with dashes:

```markdown

# Heading 1 - Largest
###### Heading 6 - Smallest

## Heading 2 - 2<sup>nd</sup> largest
### Heading 3 - 3<sup>rd</sup> largest
#### Heading 4 - 3<sup>rd</sup> smallest
##### Heading 5 - 2<sup>nd</sup> smallest

```

# Heading 1 - Largest
###### Heading 6 - Smallest

## Heading 2 - 2<sup>nd</sup> largest
### Heading 3 - 3<sup>rd</sup> largest
#### Heading 4 - 3<sup>rd</sup> smallest
##### Heading 5 - 2<sup>nd</sup> smallest

---

Notice both heading $1$ and $2$ include a line under them. This could be useful when formatting. Ignore the ```<sup>...<\/sup>``` for now, this stands for superscript and isn't required much.

### Bold & Italics

This is pretty simple:

```markdown
*Italics*
**Bold**
***Italics + Bold***
```

---

*Italics*
**Bold**
***Italics + Bold***

---

One big thing to remember is that you can't take a new line for regular text. This can only go with headers and code blocks. You are always required to skip a line.
